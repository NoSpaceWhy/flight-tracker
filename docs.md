# Why i Made this

This projects is just to find out how to get info and put it in a ui app.
I made this for my personal needs because i just don't want to see ads in some random flight tracking website

## new addition after 7 hours
This is now this is just a random flight tracker.
It does not find flight and it is all text based

# What i used
- Python
    - pygame
    - requests
- one picture
- chat gpt to create the flight.py cuz i don't know how to do requests pull
- chatgpt for searching docs of pygame
